# Dev.hunt
Introduction
Dev.hunt is a job board app that allows users to post and apply to jobs. It is built with Ruby on Rails for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and AWS S3 for storing resumes. On the front-end, it uses Material UI and React, with EmailJS for application confirmation.

## The WHY
The goal of Dev.hunt is to provide a platform for job seekers and employers in the IT to connect in a streamlined and efficient way. With the rise of remote work and the increasing demand for skilled developers, job seekers need a centralized platform to find opportunities that match their skills and interests. On the other hand, employers need an easy and effective way to reach a large pool of qualified candidates. Dev.hunt addresses these needs by offering a user-friendly job board that is accessible to both parties.
